# Watering Plants with a Raspberry Pi

This is by no means finished, but all of my raspberry pis are running other stuff, so this project is paused.

## Installation

```sh
sudo apt install nodejs npm

npm install onoff

git clone https://github.com/pichfl/spi-device-mcp3008
git clone https://github.com/Icheb1/WateringPlantsPi
